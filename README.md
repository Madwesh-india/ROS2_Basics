## Introduction

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a successor to ROS 1 and provides improved support for distributed and real-time systems. This repository offers hands-on examples and guidance to help you get up and running with ROS 2.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or later)**
- **Colcon** (for building packages)
- **Python 3.x**
- **Git** (for version control)

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [ROS 2 Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).
